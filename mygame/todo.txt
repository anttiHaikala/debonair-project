PHILOSOPHY

NOTES ON TTRPG LEGACY (inspo material to check out)
- Tomb Of Horros (original D&D book)

NOTES ON HACK
- shopkeepers
- dragons (blue red green gray black white brown purple)

NOTES ON GAME SYSTEM (the DEBONAIR!)
- how long distance is one square?
- how many seconds is the time unit? (maybe 10?) should we assume the 10 second unit?
    - it's really hard to make the combat timescale match with exploration time scale then again the starvation and sleeping timescale
