PHILOSOPHY
- make a game that 14 year old me would love
- stories over numbers
- grim, horrible stories and destinies
- always keep a lighthearted "good air" twinkle in the eye, like a charming old storyteller

TTRPG LEGACY INSPO
- Tomb Of Horrors (original D&D book)

NOTES ON HACK
- shopkeepers
- dragons (blue red green gray black white brown purple)
 - The name "zorkmid" is a reference to the Infocom text adventure series, Zork; the zorkmid is the currency used by the monarchy of Quendor, and often carries a likeness of the seventh king of the Flathead dynasty, Lord Dimwit Flathead.

NOTES ON GAME SYSTEM (the DEBONAIR!)
- how long distance is one square?
- how many seconds is the time unit? (maybe 10?) should we assume the 10 second unit?
    - it's really hard to make the combat timescale match with exploration time scale then again the starvation and sleeping timescale
