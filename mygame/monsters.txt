GRID BUG - x

The concept of gridbugs originates from the Tron franchise, which began with the 1982 Disney film Tron. Despite this, gridbugs themselves only make a brief appearance in the original film; earlier drafts indicate there was going to be a major scene featuring a gridbug swarm as a significant threat, which did not make it into the final script. Gridbugs are digital creatures that cause glitches and often appear in swarms, and are capable of "derezzing" programs and causing havoc throughout an entire system; their size varies depending on the portrayal, but they are usually depicted as four-legged "insects".

Gridbugs feature more prominently in the Tron arcade game from 1982, which was in development before the script was finalized: they appear in the I/O Tower sub-game, where the player must guide Tron to the flashing circle of an Input/Output Tower within a set time limit while avoiding or destroying gridbugs. Their inclusion in NetHack plays off the idea of the player character as a "hacker", which refers as much to programmer and geek culture as it does to the "hack 'n' slash" genre.


These electronically based creatures are not native to this
universe. They appear to come from a world whose laws of
motion are radically different from ours.
 
Tron looked to his mate and pilot. "I'm going to check on
the beam connection, Yori. You two can keep a watch out for
grid bugs." Tron paced forward along the slender catwalk
that still seemed awfully insubstantial to Flynn, though he
knew it to be amazingly sturdy. He gazed after Tron, asking
himself what in the world a grid bug was, and hoping that the
beam connection -- to which he'd given no thought whatsoever
until this moment -- was healthy and sound.
